                    <h2>A short introduction <small>Queue awkward silence!</small></h2>
                    <p>Hello, friend. Hello, friend? That's lame... I suspect you did not come here by accident, right? I mean come on, what are the odds? The universe is vast and the internet is quite big as well, so my assumption is that you can speak English and
                    somebody (man or machine) pointed you in the right direction to reach this page. So, you want to know about <strong>mini.css</strong>, right?</p>
                    <p>I'll give you the elevator pitch and then you can decide if you want to stay or leave. So, <a href="http://minicss.org">mini.css</a> is a CSS framework (yes, another one) that tries to bridge the gap between micro-frameworks and full-featured
                    UI toolkits. It's similar to things like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Foundation etc, <strong>but</strong> it's a lot lighter, more modern (based on Flexbox) and easily customizable. It's responsive, it doesn't use any Javascript, it's actively maintained,
                    what else is there that you could possibly ask for? Oh, did I mention it has some default themes you can try out without getting your hands dirty? Yes, we call them <a href="http://minicss.org/flavors.html">flavors</a>!</p>

                    <p>While <strong>mini.css</strong> provides some <a href="http://minicss.org/templates.html">templates</a> to get started, they're not as good as a full-fledged website. If only there was a platform to create such a sample website. Oh, wait, there
                    is! What was it called again? Ah, yeah, <strong>Codepen projects</strong>! Thus, this project was conjured out of thin air to better showcase what <strong>mini.css</strong> can do. But before we get started, I need to show you something really
                    important - some pictures of goats!</p><br/>

                    <p>While that might have been a bit unorthodox, the goats above were really important to this presentation. Why? Just look at them! Not them, <em>them</em>... Okay, I see why you are confused. I mean the cards where the goat pictures and my efforts
                    to make you laugh at them are! These cards are part of the framework, along with pretty much everything else you see on this page (except for the goats, I borrowed those). As you can see, cards can be used to display media and text and create
                    modern, responsive layouts. By the way, <strong>mini.css</strong> provides a pretty convenient grid system, as well. You can see it in action on this page and, as an added bonus, I will throw in a little tiled grid <del>of goat pictures</del>          to show you what it looks like.</p><br/>

                    <p>So, you stayed for the whole presentation. But, wait! There's a lot more where that came from. I cannot show you everything here, <strong>but</strong> you can take a minute to check the other two pages in this project. You will find links in the
                    header at the top of your window. If they're not there, you are probably on a mobile device and you should click on the little &quot;hamburger&quot; menu icon to see the menu and then click on one of the links to go to another page. Why do we
                    call them hamburger menus anyways? Now I'm hungry... I should go get myself a burger. While I'm away, you can also check the framework's official <a href="http://minicss.org">website</a> to learn more about it. See you around!</p><br/>
